Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.

<summary>Tips for collapsed sections</summary>

### You can add a header

You can add text within a collapsed section. 

You can add an image or a code block, too.

```ruby
   puts "Hello World"
```

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```

This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $\sqrt{\$4}$

To split <span>$</span>100 in half, we calculate $100/2$
